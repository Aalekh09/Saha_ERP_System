# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Student Payment Ledger feature will enhance the existing payment management system by providing a comprehensive view of all students' payment history, outstanding balances, and detailed transaction records. This feature will be added as a new tab within the existing "Payments" panel in the main student management interface (index.html), alongside the current payment list and add payment functionality. The implementation will not require any backend changes, utilizing the existing API endpoints and data structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view a comprehensive payment ledger for all students, so that I can quickly assess the payment status of every student in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN the ledger is loaded THEN the system SHALL show all existing students with their payment summary information
3. WHEN displaying student payment summaries THEN the system SHALL show student name, ID, total fees, total paid, and outstanding balance
4. WHEN a student has no payment records THEN the system SHALL display their outstanding balance as the full fee amount

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to view detailed payment history for each student, so that I can see all transactions, dates, amounts, and payment methods for any student.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator clicks on a student in the ledger THEN the system SHALL expand to show detailed payment history for that student
2. WHEN displaying payment history THEN the system SHALL show receipt number, payment date, amount, payment method, and description for each transaction

4. WHEN displaying payment details THEN the system SHALL calculate and show running balance after each payment

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to filter and search through the payment ledger, so that I can quickly find specific students or payment statuses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the administrator uses the search functionality THEN the system SHALL filter students by name, ID, or course
2. WHEN the administrator applies payment status filters THEN the system SHALL show only students matching the selected criteria (Paid, Partial, Outstanding)

4. WHEN filters are cleared THEN the system SHALL return to showing all students

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to see visual indicators for payment status, so that I can quickly identify students with outstanding payments or those who are fully paid.

2. WHEN a student has outstanding balance THEN the system SHALL highlight the outstanding amount prominently
3. WHEN a student is fully paid THEN the system SHALL display a "Paid" badge or indicator
4. WHEN displaying payment history THEN the system SHALL use consistent visual styling for different payment methods

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to access the add payment functionality directly from the ledger, so that I can quickly record new payments for students with outstanding balances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a student's ledger entry THEN the system SHALL provide a quick "Add Payment" button for students with outstanding balances
2. WHEN the "Add Payment" button is clicked THEN the system SHALL open the existing payment modal with the student pre-selected
3. WHEN a new payment is recorded THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the ledger to show updated balances
