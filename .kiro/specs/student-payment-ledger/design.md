# Student Payment Ledger - Design Document

## Overview

The Student Payment Ledger is a comprehensive payment management interface that will be integrated into the existing payments panel. The design maintains consistency with the current professional theme, utilizing the existing color scheme, typography, and component patterns while introducing new functionality for viewing and managing student payment records.

## Architecture

### Component Structure
```
Payments Panel
├── Tab Navigation (New)
